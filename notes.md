# Introduction

## What is it + Elastic Stack
Elasticsearch is an open-source search and analytics engine that allows for quick, scalable, and efficient searching, analyzing, and storing of large volumes of data.
It's built on Apache Lucene (search engine library written in Java!) and provides a distributed, multitenant-capable (mode of operation of software where multiple independent instances of one or multiple applications operate in a shared environment) full-text search engine with an HTTP RESTful interface and schema-free JSON documents.
Elasticsearch is widely used for log and event data analysis, real-time application monitoring, and search functionalities across various types of documents.

## History
First released in 2010. Gained popularity due to ability to scale (horizontal scaling via adding nodes to cluster) and handle large amounts of data.

Rebranded to Elastic Stack in 2015, with additional tools - Kibana, Logstash and Beats.

## Use cases + companies
Elasticsearch is used for a wide and growing range of use cases. Here are a few examples:

## Content Search Engine
Elasticsearch doesn't use concepts as primary keys or relations, since it is a schema-free/less JSON data storage. You might have noticed, I haven't used word database anywhere.

Observability

Logs, metrics, and traces: Collect, store, and analyze logs, metrics, and traces from applications, systems, and services.
Application performance monitoring (APM): Monitor and analyze the performance of business-critical software applications.
Real user monitoring (RUM): Monitor, quantify, and analyze user interactions with web applications.
OpenTelemetry: Reuse your existing instrumentation to send telemetry data to the Elastic Stack using the OpenTelemetry standard.
Search

Full-text search: Build a fast, relevant full-text search solution using inverted indexes, tokenization, and text analysis.
Vector storage: Store and search vectorized data, and create vector embeddings with built-in and third-party natural language processing (NLP) models.
Semantic search: Understand the intent and contextual meaning behind search queries using tools like synonyms, dense vector embeddings, and learned sparse query-document expansion.
Hybrid search: Combine full-text search with vector search using state-of-the-art ranking algorithms.
Build search experiences: Add hybrid search capabilities to apps or websites, or build enterprise search engines over your organizationâ€™s internal data sources.
Retrieval augmented generation (RAG): Use Elasticsearch as a retrieval engine to supplement generative AI models with more relevant, up-to-date, or proprietary data for a range of use cases.
Geospatial search: Search for locations and calculate spatial relationships using geospatial queries.
Security

Security information and event management (SIEM): Collect, store, and analyze security data from applications, systems, and services.
Endpoint security: Monitor and analyze endpoint security data.
Threat hunting: Search and analyze data to detect and respond to security threats.
