## Adding data source

Data source:
- IMDB top movies

Create a dashboard
- Create a visualization that shows only the top 5 directors and how many movies they directed that are part of the list
- Create a visualization that shows how often an IMDB rating was given in a range of ca. 0.2 steps
- Filter the visualizations to only consider movies with an IMBD rating of over 8.5
